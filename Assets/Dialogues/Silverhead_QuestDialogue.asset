  - Shhhh-
  - Didn't you hear something just now?
  - I can feel it. There's an intruder somewhere.
  - I think it's in the room behind me.
  - Can you go and check what it is? If it's suspicious, kill it right away.
  - Meanwhile, I'll go to the control room for landing.
  - Talk to me after dealing with the intruder. See you.
